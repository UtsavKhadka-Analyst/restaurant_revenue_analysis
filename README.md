# Restaurant Revenue Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing restaurant revenue data to identify key factors influencing revenue and to predict future revenue based on features such as restaurant ratings, cuisine type, and other factors. The analysis leverages **Generalized Additive Models (GAM)** for capturing non-linear relationships and **Lasso Regression** for feature selection and predictive modeling.

## Project Description

The objective of this analysis is to explore the relationship between various restaurant features and their revenue. The project performs a deep dive into the data, visualizing trends and building predictive models using **Lasso Regression** and **Generalized Additive Models (GAM)**. The insights from these models aim to help restaurant managers and analysts understand the factors influencing revenue.
